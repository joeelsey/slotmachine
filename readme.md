SlotMachine by Joe Elsey
========================

This is just a fun little project for myself so I can keep up on basic programming concepts
and hopefully when this is more functional I can add some 2D/3D graphics.


Major refactor since and this is a wip.

slotmachine.js is the main file and app.js is the old file I refactored from.


If you wanted to run this for yourself.  Just grab the code from slotmachine.js.  I run the code in terminal with node.
So, 'node slotmachine.js' and the console logs will show you the game.
